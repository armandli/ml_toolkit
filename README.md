# ml_toolkit
personal machine learning toolkit for solving ML challenges; Multiple implementations available:
1. cpp library is one without using any additional library as dependency except for stl
2. eigen library uses the eigen library as matrix class implementation
3. blas library uses openblas and cublas library
4. reader are reader implementations for machine learning purposes

#TODO

1. integrate mini-batch gradient descent
2. integrate changing learning rate
5. add asserts to block basic wrong usage
6. comment on my code
